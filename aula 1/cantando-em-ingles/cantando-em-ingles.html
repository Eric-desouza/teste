    <p>Ooh-whoa
        Balloons are deflated
        Guess they look lifeless like me
        We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
        Still got your things here
        They stare at me like souvenirs
        Don't wanna let you out my head
        <br> <br>
        
        <i>Just like the day that I met you
        The day I thought forever
        Said that you love me
        But that'll last for never
        It's cold outside
        Like when you walked out my life
        Why you walk out my life?
        </i>
        <br> <br>
        
        I get like this every time
        On these days that feel like you and me
        Heartbreak anniversary
        'Cause I remember every time
        On these days that feel like you and me
        Heartbreak anniversary
        <strong>Do you ever think of me?</strong>
        <br> <br>
        
        (Oh-ooh) no
        (Ooh) no, no, no
        (Ooh, ooh) ooh, nah (ooh)
        <br> <br>
        
        I'm buildin' my hopes up
        Like presents unopened till this day
        I still see the messages you read, mmm
        I'm foolishly patient
        (Foolishly patient)
        Can't get past the taste of your lips
        (Taste of your lips)
        Don't wanna let you out my head
        <br> <br>
        
        <i>Just like the day that I met you
        The day I thought forever
        Said that you love me
        But that'll last for never
        It's cold outside
        Like when you walked out my life
        Why you walk out my life? (My life)
        </i>
        <br> <br>
        
        I get like this every time
        On these days that feel like you and me
        Heartbreak anniversary
        'Cause I remember every time
        On these days that feel like you and me
        Heartbreak anniversary
        <strong>Do you ever think of me?</strong>
        <br> <br>
        
        (Oh-ooh) of me
        (Ooh) 'cause I think of you, think of you
        (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)<br> <br>
